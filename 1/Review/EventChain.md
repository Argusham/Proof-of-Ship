# EventChain Project Analysis Report

## Overall Scores

- **Risk Score:** 6/10 (Medium)
- **Health Score:** 5/10 (Moderate)

## Key Insights

### Developer Profile

- **Developer:** Chigozie Gift Jacob
- **Experience:** Blockchain Web Developer
- **GitHub Presence:** Established (since 2018)

### Red Flags

- Low social engagement
- Limited follower count
- No linked social media profiles

## Project Overview

The EventChain project aims to create a blockchain-based event management platform with ticket purchasing and event creation capabilities.

### Critical Observations

#### Strengths

- Diverse technology stack
- Implemented core features:
  - Event Creation
  - Event Listing
  - Ticket Purchasing
  - Basic Event Management

#### Significant Concerns

- Missing critical smart contract code (EventChain.sol)
- Incomplete implementation of promised features
- Lack of comprehensive error handling
- Incomplete event management functionality

## Technical Breakdown

### Feature Implementation

- **Event Creation:** Partially Implemented
- **Event Listing:** Implemented
- **Ticket Purchase:** Partially Implemented
- **Full Event Management:** Not Fully Implemented
- **Attendee Registration:** Missing

### Code Quality Indicators

- Frontend shows promise
- Backend (smart contract) documentation lacking
- Critical contract code not available for review

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION

While the project shows initial potential, the significant gaps in implementation and missing critical code make it a high-risk endeavor. DYOR (Do Your Own Research) is absolutely critical before any further engagement with this project.

### Key Advice

- Request complete smart contract code
- Verify all claimed functionalities
- Conduct thorough technical due diligence
- Assess the developer's ability to complete the project

## Final Verdict

The project is in a very early, incomplete stage. Significant work is required to transform it from a concept to a viable blockchain event management platform.

# EventChain Codebase Report

This report evaluates the EventChain codebase against the features described in the README.

## Implemented Features

- **Event Creation:** The frontend and backend have code for creating events with name, image URL, details, date, time, location, and ticket price.
- **Event Listing:** The codebase implements listing events and viewing details for a specific event.
- **Ticket Purchase:** The buyTicket function is present in the smart contract (implied). The frontend allows users to buy tickets using cUSD, including approval and purchase steps.
- **Event Management (Deactivation):** The deleteEventById function is present in the smart contract (implied). The frontend has functionality to deactivate events.
- **Event Attendance:** There is an AttendeeList component.

## Potential Issues and Missing Features

- **Contract Code Available:** The EventChain.sol smart contract file is available, allowing verification of the implementation of core functions.
- **addEventAttendees Function Missing:** The README mentions addEventAttendees which registers users for free events. However, there is no place in the frontend that implements this function.
- **Incomplete Event Management:** Only deactivation is implemented. The README does not specify other event management features, but common features like updating event details are missing.
- **Error Handling:** While some error handling is present in the frontend, a robust system for handling blockchain transaction errors and providing user-friendly feedback is crucial and needs deeper inspection.
- **Active Events:** The React app gets the "Active Events by Creator" and displays them. But active state functionality cannot be verified without the backend code.

## Conclusion

The codebase appears to implement the features described in the README, and the availability of the smart contract code allows for a more complete assessment.
