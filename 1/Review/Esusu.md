# Esusu Codebase Report

This report summarizes the implemented and missing features of the Esusu codebase, based on the provided README and code.

## Implemented Features:

- **Frontend:** The codebase includes a Next.js frontend with components for UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs), layout (header, footer), and pages for different functionalities (miniSafe, thrift, utility bills). It has been built with TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** The agent directory suggests implementation of connecting to smart contracts for performing on-chain transactions.
- **DApp Core Features:** The codebase implements the core functionalities such as Esusu thrift, Esusu piggy box, and Esusu pay bills.
- **AI agent assisted savings:** Chat functionalities (Chat.tsx).
- **Transaction History:** TransactionList.tsx component is available to fetch and display transaction data.

## Missing Features and Issues:

- **Stake logic in Esusu Thrift:** The Readme file says "TO DO - Fully implement the stake() logic." This confirms that it's been worked on but not complete.
- **Default Payment for thrift contribution:** The Readme claims when any user cannot meet the contribution responsibility for the month, the default payment contribution is triggered so the contributionAmount is deducted from the staked amount and also a penalty of 1 EST token. But it does not seem to be implemented.
- **MST Tokens:** Earning MST token is an important part of locking funds in piggy bank but there is no implementation to give out MST tokens.
- **Complete AI Agent Integration:** The AI agent component is present, but its functionality is not fully realized, particularly regarding DCA implementation and full Celo support.
- **Token distribution:** The tokens are mentioned in the readme (EST, MST tokens) but not in the code.
- **Utility Bills:** There are functionalities for adding merchant information, paying merchants, listing merchants.

## General Assessment:

The codebase has a functional frontend and integrates with smart contracts. The AI agent functionalities are a work in progress.
